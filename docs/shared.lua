--- In the C++ SDK, this seems not to work-- the blip isn't removed immediately. I use it for saving cars.  
--- E.g.:  
--- Ped pped = PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID();  
--- Vehicle v = PED::GET_VEHICLE_PED_IS_USING(pped);  
--- Blip b = UI::ADD_BLIP_FOR_ENTITY(v);  
--- works fine.  
--- But later attempting to delete it with:  
--- Blip b = UI::GET_BLIP_FROM_ENTITY(v);  
--- if (UI::DOES_BLIP_EXIST(b)) UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&b);  
--- doesn't work. And yes, doesn't work without the DOES_BLIP_EXIST check either. Also, if you attach multiple blips to the same thing (say, a vehicle), and that thing disappears, the blips randomly attach to other things (in my case, a vehicle).  
--- Thus for me, UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&b) only works if there's one blip, (in my case) the vehicle is marked as no longer needed, you drive away from it and it eventually despawns, AND there is only one blip attached to it. I never intentionally attach multiple blips but if the user saves the car, this adds a blip. Then if they delete it, it is supposed to remove the blip, but it doesn't. Then they can immediately save it again, causing another blip to re-appear.  
--- -------------  
--- Passing the address of the variable instead of the value works for me.  
--- e.g.  
--- int blip = UI::ADD_BLIP_FOR_ENTITY(ped);  
--- UI::REMOVE_BLIP(&blip);  
--- Remove blip will currently crash your game, just artificially remove the blip by setting the sprite to a id that is 'invisible'.  
--- --  
--- It crashes my game.

--- Activates the specified frontend menu context.
--- 
--- pausemenu.xml defines some specific menu options using 'context'. Context is basically a 'condition'.
--- 
--- The `*ALL*` part of the context means that whatever is being defined, will be active when any or all of those conditions after `*ALL*` are met.
--- 
--- The `*NONE*` part of the context section means that whatever is being defined, will NOT be active if any or all of the conditions after `*NONE*` are met.
--- 
--- This basically allows you to hide certain menu sections, or things like instructional buttons.

--- Not much is known so far on what it does *exactly*.
--- All I know for sure is that it draws the specified hole ID on the pause menu map as well as on the mini-map/radar. This native also seems to change some other things related to the pause menu map's behaviour, for example: you can no longer set waypoints, the pause menu map starts up in a 'zoomed in' state. This native does not need to be executed every tick.
--- 
--- You need to center the minimap manually as well as change/lock it's zoom and angle in order for it to appear correctly on the minimap.
--- You'll also need to use the `GOLF` scaleform in order to get the correct minmap border to show up.
--- 
--- Use [`N_0x35edd5b2e3ff01c0()`](https://runtime.fivem.net/doc/reference.html#\_0x35EDD5B2E3FF01C0) to reset the map when you no longer want to display any golf holes (you still need to unlock zoom, position and angle of the radar manually after calling this).

--- Previously named _0xD30C50DF888D58B5, this native turns on the AI blip on the specified ped. It also disappears automatically when the ped is too far or if the ped is dead. You don't need to control it with other natives.   
--- See gtaforums.com/topic/884370-native-research-ai-blips for further information.  
--- Note: Everything said at the bottom is only valid for persistant peds, as AI blips seem to behave differently for non-persistant peds.  
--- • To create an AI blip, you must use UI::0xD30C50DF888D58B5() (_SET_PED_ENEMY_AI_BLIP). It has two arguments: "ped" which is the ped you want to AI blip to be linked to, and "showViewCones" which needs to be true for AI blips to appear.  
--- • To check if a ped has an AI blip, you can use UI::DOES_PED_HAVE_AI_BLIP(Ped ped), which returns a simple bool.  
--- • By default, AI blips never disappear. If you want them to disappear when you're at a certain distance from a ped, you can use UI::0x97C65887D4B37FA9(Ped ped, float distance) (_SET_AI_BLIP_MAX_DISTANCE)  
--- • By default, the blip only appears when you're in combat with the specified ped. If you want it to be always displayed, you can use UI::x0C4BBF625CA98C4E() (_IS_AI_BLIP_ALWAYS_SHOWN). It also has two arguments: "ped", and a flag. If the flag is set to true, the blip will always be displayed. If it's set to false, the AI blip will have its default behaviour.  
--- • By default, a view cone is displayed with the blip (basically a blue surface that represents the field of view of the ped, like in vanilla stealth missions). If you don't want it, you can disable it with UI::HIDE_SPECIAL_ABILITY_LOCKON_OPERATION(Ped ped, bool flag). If the flag is set to true, the view cone is displayed. If the flag is set to false, it is not.  
--- • Finally, there's actually 3 types of AI blips:  
--- 0 - the default, red, "enemy" blip  
--- 1 - a weird, semi-transparent, nameless, yellow blip  
--- 2 - the blue "friend" blip  
--- You can change an AI blip's type with UI::0xE52B8E7F85D39A08(Ped ped, int type) (_SET_AI_BLIP_TYPE).

--- This function anchors script draws to a side of the safe zone. This needs to be called to make the interface
--- independent of the player's safe zone configuration.
--- 
--- These values are equivalent to `alignX` and `alignY` in `common:/data/ui/frontend.xml`, which can be used as a baseline
--- for default alignment.
--- 
--- Valid values for `horizontalAlign`, from original documentation:
--- 
--- *   **C (67)** - Center: DRAW_TEXT starts in the middle of the screen, while DRAW_RECT starts on the right; both move with
---     the right side of the screen.
--- *   **L (76)** - Left: Anchors to the left side, DRAW_RECT starts on the left side of the screen, same as DRAW_TEXT when
---     centered.
--- *   **R (82)** - Right: DRAW_TEXT starts on the left side (normal 0,0), while DRAW_RECT starts some short distance away
---     from the right side of the screen, both move with the right side of the screen.
--- 
--- Valid values for `verticalAlign`, from original documentation:
--- 
--- *   **B (66)** - Bottom: DRAW_RECT starts about as far as the middle of the map from the bottom, while DRAW_TEXT is about
---     rather centered.
--- *   **C (67)** - Center: It starts at a certain distance from the bottom, but the distance is fixed, the distance is
---     different from 66.
--- *   **T (84)** - Top: Anchors to the top, DRAW_RECT starts on the top of the screen, DRAW_TEXT just below it.
--- 
--- Using any other value (including 0) will result in the safe zone not being taken into account for this draw. The
--- canonical value for this is 'I' (73).
--- 
--- For example, you can use `SET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN(0, 84)` to only scale on the Y axis (to the top), but not change the X
--- axis.
--- 
--- To reset the value, use `RESET_SCRIPT_GFX_ALIGN`.
--- @usage -- align the next draw to the top left
--- SetScriptGfxAlign(string.byte('L'), string.byte('T'))
---

--- When the phone is not out, and this method is called with false as it's parameter, you will not be able to bring up the phone. Although the up arrow key still works for whatever functionality it's used for, just not for the phone.

--- Creates a new stunt jump.
--- 
--- The radius1 and radius2 might actually not be a radius at all, but that's what it seems to me testing them in-game. But they may be 'angle' floats instead, considering this native is named ADD_STUNT_JUMP\_**ANGLED**.
--- 
--- Info about the specific 'parameter sections':
--- 
--- **x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2 and radius1:**
--- 
--- First coordinates are for the jump entry area, and the radius that will be checked around that area. So if you're not exactly within the coordinates, but you are within the outter radius limit then it will still register as entering the stunt jump. Note as mentioned above, the radius is just a guess, I'm not really sure about it's exact purpose.
--- 
--- **x3, y3, z3, x4, y4, z4 and radius2:**
--- 
--- Next part is the landing area, again starting with the left bottom (nearest to the stunt jump entry zone) coordinate, and the second one being the top right furthest away part of the landing area. Followed by another (most likely) radius float, this is usually slightly larger than the entry zone 'radius' float value, just because you have quite a lot of places where you can land (I'm guessing).
--- 
--- **camX, camY and camZ:**
--- 
--- The final coordinate in this native is the Camera position. Rotation and zoom/FOV is managed by the game itself, you just need to provide the camera location.
--- 
--- **unk1, unk2 and unk3:**
--- 
--- Not sure what these are for, but they're always `150, 0, 0` in decompiled scripts.

--- Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.

--- str2 - String to be compared.  
--- matchCase - Comparison will be case-sensitive.  
--- maxLength - Maximum number of characters to compare. A value of -1 indicates an infinite length.  
--- Returns:  
--- A value indicating the relationship between the strings:  
--- <0 - The first non-matching character in 'str1' is less than the one in 'str2'. (e.g. 'A' < 'B', so result = -1)  
--- 0 - The contents of both strings are equal.  
--- >0 - The first non-matching character in 'str1' is less than the one in 'str2'. (e.g. 'B' > 'A', so result = 1)  
--- Examples:  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("STRING", "string", false, -1); // 0; equal  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("TESTING", "test", false, 4); // 0; equal  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("R2D2", "R2xx", false, 2); // 0; equal  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("foo", "bar", false, -1); // 4; 'f' > 'b'  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("A", "A", true, 1); // 0; equal  
--- When comparing case-sensitive strings, lower-case characters are greater than upper-case characters:  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("A", "a", true, 1); // -1; 'A' < 'a'  
--- GAMEPLAY::COMPARE_STRINGS("a", "A", true, 1); // 1; 'a' > 'A'

The top 2 however seem to cancel theirselves if there is noone dead around you or a fire. I only figured them out as I found out the 3rd param is definately the amountOfPeople and they called incident 3 in scripts with 4 people (which the firetruck has) and incident 5 with 2 people (which the ambulence has). The 4 param I cant say is radius, but for the pedsInCavalcades and Merryweather R* uses 0.0f and for the top 3 (Emergency Services) they use 3.0f.   
--- Side Note: It seems calling the pedsInCavalcades or Merryweather then removing it seems to break you from calling the EmergencyEvents and I also believe pedsInCavalcades. (The V cavalcades of course not IV).  
--- Side Note 2: I say it breaks as if you call this proper,  
--- if(CREATE_INCIDENT) etc it will return false if you do as I said above.

--- };  
--- As for the 'police' incident, it will call police cars to you, but unlike PedsInCavalcades & Merryweather they won't start shooting at you unless you shoot first or shoot at them. The top 2 however seem to cancel theirselves if there is noone dead around you or a fire. I only figured them out as I found out the 3rd param is definately the amountOfPeople and they called incident 3 in scripts with 4 people (which the firetruck has) and incident 5 with 2 people (which the ambulence has). The 4 param I cant say is radius, but for the pedsInCavalcades and Merryweather R* uses 0.0f and for the top 3 (Emergency Services) they use 3.0f.   
--- Side Note: It seems calling the pedsInCavalcades or Merryweather then removing it seems to break you from calling the EmergencyEvents and I also believe pedsInCavalcades. (The V cavalcades of course not IV).  
--- Side Note 2: I say it breaks as if you call this proper,  
--- if(CREATE_INCIDENT) etc it will return false if you do as I said above.

--- According to how I understood this in the freemode script alone,  
--- The first parameter is determined by a function named, func_5749 within the freemode script which has a list of all the vehicles and a set price to return which some vehicles deals with globals as well. So the first parameter is basically the set in stone insurance cost it's gonna charge you for that specific vehicle model.  
--- The second parameter whoever put it was right, they call GET_ENTITY_MODEL with the vehicle as the paremeter.  
--- The third parameter is the network handle as they call their little struct<13> func or atleast how the script decompiled it to look which in lamens terms just returns the network handle of the previous owner based on DECOR_GET_INT(vehicle, "Previous_Owner").  
--- The fourth parameter is a bool that returns true/false depending on if your bank balance is greater then 0.  
--- The fifth and last parameter is a bool that returns true/false depending on if you have the money for the car based on the cost returned by func_5749. In the freemode script eg,  
--- bool hasTheMoney = NETWORKCASH::_GET_BANK_BALANCE() < carCost.

--- p5, p6 and p7 seems to be about the same as p4, p5 and p6 for GET_CLOSEST_VEHICLE_NODE. p6 and/or p7 has something to do with finding a node on the same path/road and same direction(at least for this native, something to do with the heading maybe). Edit this when you find out more.  
--- p5 is either 1 or 12. 1 means any path/road. 12, 8, 0 means node in the middle of the closest main (asphalt) road.  
--- p6 is always 3.0  
--- p7 is always 0.  
--- Known node types: simple path/asphalt road, only asphalt road, water, under the map at always the same coords.   
--- The node types follows a pattern. For example, every fourth node is of the type water i.e. 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39... 239. Could not see any difference between nodes within certain types.   
--- Starting at 2, every fourth node is under the map, always same coords.  
--- Same with only asphalt road (0, 4, 8, etc) and simple path/asphalt road (1, 5, 9, etc).

--- An **angled area** is an X-Z oriented rectangle with three parameters:
--- 
--- 1.  **origin**: the mid-point along a base edge of the rectangle;
--- 2.  **extent**: the mid-point of opposite base edge on the other Z;
--- 3.  **width**: the length of the base edge; (named derived from logging strings `CNetworkRoadNodeWorldStateData`).
--- 
--- The oriented rectangle can then be derived from the direction of the two points (`norm(origin - extent)`), its orthonormal, and the width, e.g:

--- When attached, Position<vector> does not matter  
--- When attached, Angle<vector> does not matter  
--- Rope Type:  
--- 4 and bellow is a thick rope  
--- 5 and up are small metal wires  
--- 0 crashes the game  
--- Max_length - Rope is forced to this length, generally best to keep this the same as your rope length.  
--- Rigid - If max length is zero, and this is set to false the rope will become rigid (it will force a specific distance, what ever length is, between the objects).  
--- breakable - Whether or not shooting the rope will break it.  
--- unkPtr - unknown ptr, always 0 in orig scripts  
--- __  
--- Lengths can be calculated like so:  
--- float distance = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) + abs(z1 - z2); // Rope length  
--- NOTES:  
--- Rope does NOT interact with anything you attach it to, in some cases it make interact with the world AFTER it breaks (seems to occur if you set the type to -1).  
--- Rope will sometimes contract and fall to the ground like you'd expect it to, but since it doesn't interact with the world the effect is just jaring.

--- b2 and/or b3 maybe got something to do with keeping values from the last ped. Both of them set to 1 works great. <br/><br/>Examples from the decompiled scripts:<br/><br/>PLAYER::CHANGE_PLAYER_PED(PLAYER::PLAYER_ID(), l_5C0[4/*14*/], 0, 1);<br/>PLAYER::CHANGE_PLAYER_PED(PLAYER::PLAYER_ID(), a_0[a_0._f7/*1*/], a_2, 0);<br/><br/><br/>===========================================================<br/>The only way I ever got this to work in GTA Online once is by setting both to 0, 0. However, when you switch from your online character to whomever, your character will start walking away 'as if you left the game.' If from there you attempt to call this native once more to switch back to you online ped. You will freeze or if you try changing to another ped. I've tried all posibilities so far.<br/>1, 1 (Freeze), 0, 0(Works Once), 1, 0 & 0, 1 (Freeze). Note of course trying to call this on another online player will crash. Anyone have any idea if implementing a blr within the xex itself on a possible check if it would prevent this freezing?<br/>===========================================================

--- Not sure how or why this differs from 0x7EE9F5D83DD4F90E, but it does.  
--- This function casts a ray from Point1 to Point2 and returns it's ray handle.  A simple ray cast will 'shoot' a line from point A to point B, and return whether or not the ray reached it's destination or if it hit anything and if it did hit anything, will return the handle of what it hit (entity handle) and coordinates of where the ray reached.  
--- You can use _GET_RAYCAST_RESULT to get the result of the raycast  
--- Entity is an entity to ignore, such as the player.  
--- Flags are intersection bit flags.  They tell the ray what to care about and what not to care about when casting. Passing -1 will intersect with everything, presumably.  
--- Flags:  
--- 1: Intersect with map  
--- 2: Intersect with vehicles (used to be mission entities?) (includes train)  
--- 4: Intersect with peds? (same as 8)  
--- 8: Intersect with peds? (same as 4)  
--- 16: Intersect with objects  
--- 32: Water?  
--- 64: Unknown  
--- 128: Unknown  
--- 256: Intersect with vegetation (plants, coral. trees not included)  
--- NOTE: Raycasts that intersect with mission_entites (flag = 2) has limited range and will not register for far away entites. The range seems to be about 30 metres.

--- Parameters:  
--- rayHandle - Ray Handle from a casted ray, as returned by CAST_RAY_POINT_TO_POINT  
--- hit - Where to store whether or not it hit anything. False is when the ray reached its destination.  
--- endCoords - Where to store the world-coords of where the ray was stopped (by hitting its desired max range or by colliding with an entity/the map)  
--- surfaceNormal - Where to store the surface-normal coords (NOT relative to the game world) of where the entity was hit by the ray

--- Returns:  
--- Result? Some type of enum.  
--- NOTE: To get the offset-coords of where the ray hit relative to the entity that it hit (which is NOT the same as surfaceNormal), you can use these two natives:

--- 	const int arrSize = numElements * 2 + 2;

--- //Simple loop to go through results

--- This native sets the glow intensity of illuminated clothing items.
--- 
--- This native does **NOT** need to be executed every tick.
--- This native is **NOT** synced with other connected players, you will have to set the opacity on the ped on all clients individually.
--- 
--- Glow intensity is a value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
--- 
--- In some older decompiled scripts this is known as `_SET_PED_REFLECTION_INTENSITY`.
--- Since there's no joaat hash for this, I find `_SET_PED_ILLUMINATED_CLOTHING_GLOW_INTENSITY` more descriptive than `_SET_PED_REFLECTION_INTENSITY`.
--- 
--- Use [`GetPedIlluminatedClothingGlowIntensity`](#\_0x1461B28A06717D68) to get the illuminated clothing glow intensity of a specific ped.

--- The entity will move towards the target until time is over (duration) or get in target's range (distance). p5 and p6 are unknown, but you could leave p5 = 1073741824 or 100 or even 0 (didn't see any difference but on the decompiled scripts, they use 1073741824 mostly) and p6 = 0  
--- Note: I've only tested it on entity -> ped and target -> vehicle. It could work differently on other entities, didn't try it yet.  
--- Example: AI::TASK_GO_TO_ENTITY(pedHandle, vehicleHandle, 5000, 4.0, 100, 1073741824, 0)

--- After looking at some scripts the second parameter seems to be an id of some kind. Here are some I found from some R* scripts:  
--- "miss_Tower_01" (this went from 01 - 10)  
--- "miss_Ass0" (0, 4, 6, 3)  
--- "MISS_PATROL_8"  
--- I think they're patrol routes, but I'm not sure. And I believe the 3rd parameter is a BOOL, but I can't confirm other than only seeing 0 and 1 being passed.

--- The ped will walk or run towards goToLocation, aiming towards goToLocation or focusLocation (depending on the aimingFlag) and shooting if shootAtEnemies = true to any enemy in his path.  
--- If the ped is closer than noRoadsDistance, the ped will ignore pathing/navmesh and go towards goToLocation directly. This could cause the ped to get stuck behind tall walls if the goToLocation is on the other side. To avoid this, use 0.0f and the ped will always use pathing/navmesh to reach his destination.  
--- If the speed is set to 0.0f, the ped will just stand there while aiming, if set to 1.0f he will walk while aiming, 2.0f will run while aiming.  
--- The ped will stop aiming when he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation.  
--- I still can't figure out what unkTrue is used for. I don't notice any difference if I set it to false but in the decompiled scripts is always true.  
--- I think that unkFlag, like the driving styles, could be a flag that "work as a list of 32 bits converted to a decimal integer. Each bit acts as a flag, and enables or disables a function". What leads me to this conclusion is the fact that in the decompiled scripts, unkFlag takes values like: 0, 1, 5 (101 in binary) and 4097 (4096 + 1 or 1000000000001 in binary). For now, I don't know what behavior enable or disable this possible flag so I leave it at 0.  
--- Note: After some testing, using unkFlag = 16 (0x10) enables the use of sidewalks while moving towards goToLocation.  
--- The aimingFlag takes 2 values: 0 to aim at the focusLocation, 1 to aim at where the ped is heading (goToLocation).  
--- Example:  
--- enum AimFlag  
--- {  
---    AimAtFocusLocation,  
---    AimAtGoToLocation  
--- };  
--- Vector3 goToLocation1 = { 996.2867f, 0, -2143.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.  
--- Vector3 goToLocation2 = { 990.2867f, 0, -2140.044f, 0, 28.4763f, 0 }; // remember the padding.  
--- Vector3 focusLocation = { 994.3478f, 0, -2136.118f, 0, 29.2463f, 0 }; // the coord z should be a little higher, around +1.0f to avoid aiming at the ground  
--- // 1st example  
--- AI::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation1.x, goToLocation1.y, goToLocation1.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 2.0f /*run*/, true /*shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtGoToLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);  
--- // 2nd example  
--- AI::TASK_GO_TO_COORD_AND_AIM_AT_HATED_ENTITIES_NEAR_COORD(pedHandle, goToLocation2.x, goToLocation2.y, goToLocation2.z, focusLocation.x, focusLocation.y, focusLocation.z, 1.0f /*walk*/, false /*don't shoot*/, 3.0f /*stop at*/, 0.0f /*noRoadsDistance*/, true /*always true*/, 0 /*possible flag*/, AimFlag::AimAtFocusLocation, -957453492 /*FullAuto pattern*/);  
--- 1st example: The ped (pedhandle) will run towards goToLocation1. While running and aiming towards goToLocation1, the ped will shoot on sight to any enemy in his path, using "FullAuto" firing pattern. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation1.  
--- 2nd example: The ped will walk towards goToLocation2. This time, while walking towards goToLocation2 and aiming at focusLocation, the ped will point his weapon on sight to any enemy in his path without shooting. The ped will stop once he is closer than distanceToStopAt to goToLocation2.

--- In every case of this native, I've only seen the first parameter passed as 0, although I believe it's a Ped after seeing tasks around it using 0. That's because it's used in a Sequence Task.  
--- The last 3 parameters are definitely coordinates after seeing them passed in other scripts, and even being used straight from the player's coordinates.  
--- ---  
--- It seems that - in the decompiled scripts - this native was used on a ped who was in a vehicle to throw a projectile out the window at the player. This is something any ped will naturally do if they have a throwable and they are doing driveby-combat (although not very accurately).  
--- It is possible, however, that this is how SWAT throws smoke grenades at the player when in cover.  
--- ----------------------------------------------------  
--- The first comment is right it definately is the ped as if you look in script finale_heist2b.c line 59628 in Xbox Scripts atleast you will see task_throw_projectile and the first param is Local_559[2 <14>] if you look above it a little bit line 59622 give_weapon_to_ped uses the same exact param Local_559[2 <14>] and we all know the first param of that native is ped. So it guaranteed has to be ped. 0 just may mean to use your ped by default for some reason.

--- pilot, vehicle and altitude are rather self-explanatory.  
--- p4: is unused variable in the function.  
--- entityToFollow: you can provide a Vehicle entity or a Ped entity, the heli will protect them.  
--- 'targetSpeed':  The pilot will dip the nose AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE so as to reach this value AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.  As such, you'll want to modulate it as opposed to calling it via a hard-wired, constant #.  
--- 'radius' isn't just "stop within radius of X of target" like with ground vehicles.  In this case, the pilot will fly an entire circle around 'radius' and continue to do so.  
--- NOT CONFIRMED:  p7 appears to be a FlyingStyle enum.  Still investigating it as of this writing, but playing around with values here appears to result in different -behavior- as opposed to offsetting coordinates, altitude, target speed, etc.  
--- NOTE: If the pilot finds enemies, it will engage them until it kills them, but will return to protect the ped/vehicle given shortly thereafter.

Call it in with the Ped's updated coordinates every 20 ticks or so and you will have one hell of a smart, fast-reacting NPC driver -- provided he doesn't get stuck.  If your update frequency is too fast, the Ped may not have enough time to figure his way out of being stuck, and thus, remain stuck.  One way around this would be to implement an "anti-stuck" mechanism, which allows the driver to realize he's stuck, temporarily pause the tick, unstuck, then resume the tick.  
--- EDIT:  This is being discussed in more detail at http://gtaforums.com/topic/818504-any-idea-on-how-to-make-peds-clever-and-insanely-fast-c/

--- Example usage  
--- VEHICLE::GET_CLOSEST_VEHICLE(x, y, z, radius, hash, unknown leave at 70)   
--- x, y, z: Position to get closest vehicle to.  
--- radius: Max radius to get a vehicle.  
--- modelHash: Limit to vehicles with this model. 0 for any.  
--- flags: The bitwise flags altering the function's behaviour.  
--- Does not return police cars or helicopters.  
--- It seems to return police cars for me, does not seem to return helicopters, planes or boats for some reason  
--- Only returns non police cars and motorbikes with the flag set to 70 and modelHash to 0. ModelHash seems to always be 0 when not a modelHash in the scripts, as stated above.   
--- These flags were found in the b617d scripts: 0,2,4,6,7,23,127,260,2146,2175,12294,16384,16386,20503,32768,67590,67711,98309,100359.  
--- Converted to binary, each bit probably represents a flag as explained regarding another native here: gtaforums.com/topic/822314-guide-driving-styles  
--- Conversion of found flags to binary: pastebin.com/kghNFkRi  
--- At exactly 16384 which is 0100000000000000 in binary and 4000 in hexadecimal only planes are returned.   
--- It's probably more convenient to use worldGetAllVehicles(int *arr, int arrSize) and check the shortest distance yourself and sort if you want by checking the vehicle type with for example VEHICLE::IS_THIS_MODEL_A_BOAT  
--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------  
--- Conclusion: This native is not worth trying to use. Use something like this instead: pastebin.com/xiFdXa7h
--- Use flag 127 to return police cars

--- Vehicle power multiplier.  
--- Does not have to be looped each frame. Can be set once.  
--- Values lower than 1f don't work.  
--- Note: If the value is set with GET_RANDOM_FLOAT_IN_RANGE, the vehicle will have an absurdly high ammount of power, and will become almost undrivable for the player or NPCs. The range doesn't seem to matter.  
--- An high value like 10000000000f will visually remove the wheels that apply the power (front wheels for FWD, rear wheels for RWD), but the power multiplier will still apply, and the wheels still work.

--- I've only seen this work for `deluxo` though, can't figure out what it's supposed to do on `oppressor2`.
--- 
--- For the deluxo:
--- 
--- *   Set `state` to `0.0`: Fully transform to a 'road' vehicle (non-hover mode).
--- *   Set `state` to `1.0`: Fully transform to a 'flying' vehicle (hover mode).
---

--- This doesn't need to be called every tick, just once and the vehicle will transform to that state at the usual transform speed. It'll just stop transforming when it reaches the state you provided.
